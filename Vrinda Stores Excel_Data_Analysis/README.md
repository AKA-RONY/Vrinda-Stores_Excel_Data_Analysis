----------------------------

THINGS I DO GENERALLY BEFORE WORKING ON DATASET:-
---------------------------------------------------
-> Highlevel overview of data <br>
-> what are the data points <br>
-> can it solve the business problem or not <br>

MAIN PART:-
---
A) DATA CLEANING - In data cleaning we first cross check the data of every column,whether all the data is correct or not. <br>
   i) There should be no duplicate/repeating or  null value <br>
   ii) The values should be consistent. ex- gender column has some inconsistent values(men, m, women, w) & qty column has some inconsistent values, make them in proper format<br>
   iii) Their should be no outliers, go through every column carefully!<br>
   iv) check if any values are mispelled.<br>
   
B) DATA PROCESSING -It means we want to calculate some values or want to process any data that would help us in our analysis process. Includes working with formulas,etc. <br> 

Lets begin solving our qtns:- <br>
q6.soln:-  like there was a qtn related to gender and age and show their relationship. But if we want to see the relationship individually its not possible. So, to do that we have to group the age values into teenage(<30 yrs ),adult(>=30-49 yrs), senior( >=50). <br>
To do this we need to apply condition as follows:- <br>
